Test for 100 different alpha values logarithmically spaced from 10^-5 to 10^5

Each alpha point is calculated 50 times to obtain the variance and RMSE

Each sweep through alpha is done for leave one out cross validation with the dataset of experimentally obtained values.

The resultant plots are the averages of the values for all of our different experiments for cross validation.

Perhaps should add error bars to the mean experiments so that we can have certainty when finding our alpha value based on the intrinsic data we are testing.
