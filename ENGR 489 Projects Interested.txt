SupervisorProjectDescriptionBastiaan KleijnDistributed Processing VisualizationAn exciting new research area that is growing rapidly and has many applications is distributed processing. In distributed processing nodes of a network perform computations together.  Distributed processing can handle unlimited amounts of data (just add nodes) and it is robust to failure. At Victoria we are working on distributed algorithms that can be applied to sensor networks: the data are observed by the sensors and then jointly processed by processors placed in the sensors.  Each sensor only talks to its nearby neighbors. Our networks can contain any number of nodes but yet the algorithms are formulated such that answers will always be delivered in finite time. The idea is that a user requests a task from a network at a "query node", the network then performs the task and it finally delivers the answer to that same query node. A concrete example is an acoustic beam forrmer where the sensors (microphones) together extract the signal produced by one sound source (for example a talker) out of a cluttered acoustic environment with many sound sources.  We have recordings for a setup with 64 microphones and your task is to build a  demonstration system that visualiizes the processing by the various distributed algorithms. You will work with the team (a postdoc, a PhD student, and the supervisor) to implement or adapt distributed algorithms and to design and implement a visualization of the processing, showing the pathways of the information and the accuracy of any signal estimates available at various points within the network. The demonstraition system will provide the user with the ability to listen to processed signals at various locations within the network.The project requires a solid background in mathematics.Christopher HollittHigh Speed Vision for Cricket Ball Tracking
