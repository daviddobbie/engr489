\begin{abstract}

Effective measurements of NMR relaxation have typically been constrained to high SNR environments due to the adverse effect that noise can have. Inversion of the measured data to its relaxation density function is an ill-posed problem. The current literature has worked on increasing the accuracy of inversion given only measured data and the nature of the noise. These techniques have been recreated and bench marked in this report. This project seeks to use Bayesian techniques to integrate prior data based on high quality measurements in order to make more accurate inversions of  measured data. This is used to compute the bound fluid fraction of porous  media to assess the difficulty of fluid extraction.
