Version 1.5 of the Bayesian technqiue.

Extracts experimental data to make prior. Use leave one out cross validation of the experimental data. This means that it is all in a similar domain.

This version is to experiment with a density function covariance given by the experimental data. It estimates the entrie covariance so that the points and its neighbours interact with each to lead to a more accurate estimation.

Reduction of error dependent on experimental data as well as variance estimation.
