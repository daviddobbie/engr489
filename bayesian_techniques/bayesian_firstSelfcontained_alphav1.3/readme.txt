Version 1.3 of the Bayesian technqiue.

Extracts experimental data to make prior. Use leave one out cross validation of the experimental data. This means that it is all in a similar domain.

This version aims to be selfcontained, so only the intrinsic data is used to estimate the best alpha to estimate the density function uncertainty.

Reduction of error dependent on experimental data as well as variance estimation.
Desnity function covariance is an equally scaled diagonal matrix - no weighting made.
