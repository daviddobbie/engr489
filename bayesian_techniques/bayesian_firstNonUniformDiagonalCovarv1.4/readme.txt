Version 1.4 of the Bayesian technqiue.

Extracts experimental data to make prior. Use leave one out cross validation of the experimental data. This means that it is all in a similar domain.

This version is to experiment with a density function covariance given by the experimental data. It is to model our uncertainty for different desnity function points.

Reduction of error dependent on experimental data as well as variance estimation.
