Resukts are for M4 distribution in Venk 2015

* As we increase the echo spacing interval, the distributions with more weight at lower relaxation times become considerably less precise.
* This tehcnique allows for working around the limits of echo spacing for the ILT algortihm. The small expense in precision helps to obtain increased accuracy.
